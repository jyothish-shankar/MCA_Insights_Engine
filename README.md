## üîÑ Data Workflow

1. **Raw Data:**  
   Starts with the `mca_master.csv` file containing foundational company data.

2. **Enrichment:**  
   The `Enriched.csv` and `log.csv` files provide supplementary data. Enrichment is done via manual or semi-automated scraping to gather details not present in the master file, such as director names.

3. **Loading & Cleaning:**  
   The `load_data()` function in the Streamlit app reads all CSV files, cleans column headers, and standardizes data types (e.g., converts dates).

4. **Interactive Visualization:**  
   Cleaned data is displayed in the Streamlit dashboard, enabling filtering, searching, and real-time visualization.

5. **AI Insights:**  
   The `log.csv` data feeds into the AI Summary Generator to produce high-level reports on corporate activity.
