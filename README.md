MCA Insights Engine
This project is a Python application designed to consolidate, track, enrich, and visualize company master data from the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA), as published on data.gov.in. The application transforms raw, state-wise CSV files into an interactive, AI-powered dashboard for compliance, credit assessment, and risk monitoring.

(Note: You can take a screenshot of your running dashboard, upload it to a site like Imgur, and paste the link here to display an image.)

üöÄ Features
Data Consolidation: Merges and cleans raw company data from multiple state-wise CSV files into a single, canonical master dataset.

Data Enrichment: Gathers supplementary information (like Director Names and full addresses) for a sample of companies from public sources (e.g., ZaubaCorp).

Interactive Dashboard: A web-based interface built with Streamlit that allows users to:

Search for companies by CIN or Name.

Filter the dataset by State, Company Status, and Year of Incorporation.

View detailed company information and enriched data.

Visualize a company's change history over time.

AI-Powered Summaries: Automatically generates a concise daily summary report highlighting key changes and trends found in the data logs.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
Language: Python 3.x

Data Manipulation: Pandas

Web Dashboard: Streamlit

Data Visualization: Plotly Express

Web Scraping (Optional): BeautifulSoup4, Playwright/Selenium


üîÑ Data Workflow
The application follows a simple yet powerful data pipeline:

Raw Data: The process starts with the mca_master.csv file, which contains the foundational company data.

Enrichment: The Enriched.csv and log.csv files provide supplementary data. The enrichment was performed through a manual or semi-automated scraping process to gather details not present in the master file, such as director names.

Loading & Cleaning: When the Streamlit app starts, the load_data() function reads all CSV files, cleans their column headers, and standardizes data types (e.g., converts dates).

Interactive Visualization: The cleaned data is then presented in the Streamlit dashboard, where users can filter, search, and visualize it in real-time.

AI Insights: The log.csv data is fed into the AI Summary Generator to produce a high-level report on corporate activity.
